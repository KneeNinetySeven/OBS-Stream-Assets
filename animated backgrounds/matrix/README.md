## Configuration
To configure the static box elements, please add these into the json object in the very beginning of the file.


```
const staticObjects = {
        boxes: [
            {
                anchor: {x: 4, y: 4},
                width: 40,
                height: 15
            },
            {
                anchor: {x: colCount - 47, y: 5},
                width: 43,
                height: 38
            }
        ]
    }
```

Further, you can change the text main color by updating the variable ```mainColorRGB```. It **MUST** be noted as RGB values, separated by a comma. No decimals or anything at the end.
