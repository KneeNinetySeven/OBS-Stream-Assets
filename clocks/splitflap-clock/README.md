### The clock

_The black background is just there due to the recording. The clocks background is 100% transparent_

## Configuration
**Nothing to configure - Just embed. Done.**

Ideally embedded with the dimensions 500 x 200 (w x h).
But attention: Keep the subfolders 'js' and 'css' next to the html file! Otherwise nothing will work anymore.
